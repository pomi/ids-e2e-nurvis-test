    Given SOLR is requested for packages from AMS airport to Egypte for 1 adults
      | Room | Adults | Children | Infants |
      | 1    | 2      | 0        | 0       |
      | 2    | 2      | 2        | 1       |

    And SOLR response has available packages
    When NURVIS is requested for booking
    And NURVIS returns booking ID
    And Nurvis booking
    And ontour xml is created
    And ontour xml is put on sftp
    And booking is processed
    Then I should see a booking with same number exists in msD
    And booking in msD should have same details as were set in onTour XML
